>The `may not` reliable public proxy servers list<br />
>But your proxies are eventually tested every 5 minutes.

I like kingproxies.com. So I made up my mind to build this project.

## Aims
Community-Driven free proxy server list!

## Features

### Will be updated continuously if you add one or more manually
Thousands of new proxies are `not` being added daily and dead proxies are `not`  removed.

But each proxy is tested every 5 minutes. The proxies are then ranked by how often they are alive, so you're sure to receive the most reliable proxies available(yes, if you add them manually)

### May not high anonymity.
We are not verify that your real IP address is hidden when using the Anonymous proxies. But if you tend to use proxy to hide the fact, find the Elite High Anonymous proxies and add them manually.

### Not-so-powerful API.
We've built a [RESTful API](API.md) that is fully documented and easy to use.

Results are delivered JSON only.
